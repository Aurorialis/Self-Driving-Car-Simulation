Architecture coding


Want it all based on real life
    Use pixel to meter conversion

    Car:
        Length:     5 meters    (Civic = 4.6 m = 182")
        Max Vel:    18 m/s      (40 mph)
        Max Acc:    3 m/s^2     (0-60 in say 10 s =>  26 m/s / 10 s => 2.6 m/s^2)
        Max Dec:    7 m/s^2     (60-0 in 120 ft)

    Assumption:
        If going Max Vel thru intersection, always able to stop before next intersection w/ full dec

    Intersection:
        Int_Dist >= 25 m        (D = v_m^2 /(2*a_m) = 18^2 / 14 = 23.1 m 
        add Car Length
        Int_dist >= 30 m (ie 6 car lengths)


    Pixel-to-Meter Ratio
        1 pix = 0.5 m
        10 pixel car
        Minimum 60 pixel Intersection distance


###
Everything should be in meters, and continuous (float)
Only the GUI will be discretized
###

GUI
    Display environment (car positions, updated every timestep)

    Needs:
        number of rows, cols, window dimensions, intersection radius

Env
    Hold all information
    States of all cars  (position, velocity, acceleration)
